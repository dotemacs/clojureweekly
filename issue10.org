* Clojure Weekly #10

Welcome to the tenth Cloljure Weekly!

Hold your breath while I self high five and self pat on the back.

There, now you can enjoy the rest of the newsletter.

** Interesting

That Clojure has the ability to positively affect your code is no
secret, but it's nice when you see the approches from Clojure (in this
case, from re-frame specifically), [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23183558][leak to other projects]], like the
latest React state management library, Recoil.

A bit of a drama ensued when cljs-devtools [[https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools/releases/tag/v1.0.1][announced that Chrome
browser might be phasing out custom formatters]]. With the discussion on
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/gnngzb/the_devtools_apocalypse/][reddit]] and this [[https://twitter.com/ChromeDevTools/status/1263421789671239681][thread on Twitter]].

Two announcements from Clojurists Together:

- [[https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/announcing-summer-of-bugs/][Summer of bugs]] - a way to take sponsorship from Clojurists Together,
  to work in a short pertiod, to fix some smaller bugs.

- [[https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/announcing-the-clojurists-together-foundation/][The formation of the foundation]] - as a foundation it'll have more
  flexibility about the way the sponsorship is done. But don't take my
  word for it, please read their announcement. With a [[https://lobste.rs/s/odhduy/announcing_clojurists_together][discussion]] on
  lobste.rs.

Clojure implementation for the CLR, [[https://github.com/nasser/magic][MAGIC]], compiled [[https://twitter.com/ra/status/1263583951303569408][100% of core.clj]].

But MAGIC is not to be confused with the ClojureCLR, which is close to
1.10 release, [[https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/clojure-clr/2v9xls5hreE][link]].

Thomas Heller shows us how to use WebAssembly code in a CLJS, [[https://github.com/thheller/wasm-pack-cljs][repo]].

Clojars now allows [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/clojure/GmAU4XwnRpw/oetRCb0UCgAJ][deploy tokens support]].

ClojuTre 2020 has been [[https://clojutre.org/2020/][postponed]].

*defold game engine* - Cognitect helped them with the
project. Announcement [[https://defold.com/2020/05/19/Defold-is-now-open-source/][here]], talk by Michael Nygard & Ragnar Svensson
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajX09xQ_UEg][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/gmkzad/king_is_making_its_defold_game_engine_open_source/][reddit]] & [[https://lobste.rs/s/ykf10v/king_releases_defold_game_engine_under][lobste.rs]] discussions.
